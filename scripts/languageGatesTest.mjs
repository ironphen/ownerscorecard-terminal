// The qualitative desks' pinned quote suite (Build 1 of the 2026-07-30 survey,
// docs/qualitative-desks-survey.md). Every sentence below is VERBATIM from a live filing via
// language.json on the day the defect was measured — pinned as literals so the suite never
// drifts with the data. Two halves, and both matter equally: the known-bad set must DIE under
// the narrowed gates (each was rendering a false claim on a real company's page), and the
// known-good set must SURVIVE them (a hygiene pass that kills a true material weakness is a
// worse defect than the ones it fixes). Bank of Marin appears on both sides deliberately: its
// cybersecurity-program boilerplate must stop wearing the Litigation flag while its GENUINE
// deposit-restatement banner and its genuine admission keep rendering — the proof the pass is
// a scalpel, not a mower.
